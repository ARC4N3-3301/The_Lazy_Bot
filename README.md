THE LAZY BOT (A DISCORD BOT)

One of the most unique features of the multi-level communication platform Discord is its bots. These bots are AIs that can perform a number of useful automated tasks on your server, such as welcoming new members, moderating content, and banning rule breakers. They can also add music, memes, games, and other content to your server. Discord bots can bring your experience to the next level whether youâ€™re an admin looking for help moderating your server or a user looking for new ways to interact with fellow server members.

The lazy bot makes one's life easier by doing small tasks that a person has to do regularly yet annoying. The bot is hosted on a cloud platform (Heroku). 
Here's the invite link of the bot: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=741374968612257852&scope=bot&permissions=0

The bot can be used for many purposes, and it is especially useful in cryptic hunts.
The bot needs some administrative permissions to work at its best. 

The command prefix is: '$'

Use $help in a server for knowing it's commands.
